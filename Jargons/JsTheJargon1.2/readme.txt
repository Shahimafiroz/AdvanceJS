A cohort typically refers to a group of individuals who share a common characteristic or experience within a defined period. In various fields such as sociology, epidemiology, and education, cohorts are often studied to understand trends, behaviors, or outcomes over time. For example, in epidemiology, a cohort study might track a group of people exposed to a particular risk factor to determine the incidence of disease compared to a control group. In education, researchers might study a cohort of students who entered school in the same year to track their academic progress over time. Cohort analysis can provide valuable insights into how different factors influence outcomes within a specific group.
